# Modern Python Cookbook

This is my repo following the book "Modern Python Cookbook" by Steven F. Lott.

Synopsis taken from the book: By exposing Python as a series of simple recipes, you can gain insights into specific language features in a particular context. Having a tangible context helps make the language or standard library feature easier to understand.
